          <p>
            I grew up in Ohio, I graduated from New Philadelphia High School in
            2016. Since I graduated I have became interested in programming so i
            started learning Front-End Web Development on my own in 2018. The
            main things I have started learning are HTML, CSS/CSS Grid, SASS,
            BootStrap, Javascript and just started learning React.
          </p>

        <div class="job job-1">
          <h3>HTML, CSS</h3>
          <p>
            I have been learning the newest HTML5 and CSS3, including CSS Grid
            and FLexbox. Then went on to learning frameworks like Bootstrap,
            Material UI, and Materialize CSS.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="job job-2">
          <h3>Javascript</h3>
          <p>
            I am not a Javascript expert yet, but have been using it to make my
            websites and layouts more interactive, and better for the user.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="job job-3">
          <h3>Javascript Frameworks & Librarys</h3>
          <p>
            This is where my learning has came to now. There are so many
            Javascript frameworks to learn but I have started learning React. I
            chose this because its growing in popularity and helps you build
            more complex websites/web apps without getting messy code.
